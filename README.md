# JustIT Bootcamp Workbook Activities

> In this bootcamp, we had a total of 5 weeks of activities to develop our analytical thinking and core technical skills using scenarios and various datasets to answer business questions.

## Bootcamp Project: Data Analytics Fundamentals

This project showcases the foundational data analytics skills I acquired in during my bootcamp.

## Week 2: Introduction to Visualisation Tools - Tableau and Power BI

This week focused on gaining proficiency with industry-standard data visualization tools, Tableau and Microsoft Power BI, alongside practical data analysis exercises.

### Key Skills & Concepts Learned in Week 2

* **Tableau:**
  * Researched and compared different Tableau versions, understanding the functionalities and limitations [e.g., Tableau Public](cite: 13).
  * Created dashboards using datasets like EMSI\_JobChange\_UK, visualizing data with bar charts (percentage change) and geographical maps [key city locations](cite: 14).
* **Microsoft Power BI:**
  * Mastered fundamental Power BI Desktop skills, including data acquisition (`Get Data`)[cite: 27].
  * Designed effective reports within Power BI Desktop[cite: 29].
  * Created interactive Power BI dashboards[cite: 31].
* **Data Analysis & Interpretation:**
  * **Spotify Dataset Analysis:** Analyzed trends to inform potential organizational projects[cite: 15]. Investigated the relationship between track 'danceability' and 'popularity', concluding that popularity is influenced by multiple factors beyond just danceability[cite: 16, 17, 18].
  * **Health Dataset Analysis:** Analyzed health data to identify trends for potential organizational support[cite: 19]. Found higher cancer aggregates in men compared to women (2005-2008) across various cancer types (liver, stomach, lung), despite a slightly smaller male population[cite: 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. Identified potential areas for NHS investigation regarding lifestyle, work, or genetic factors influencing higher cancer rates in men[cite: 25, 26].
