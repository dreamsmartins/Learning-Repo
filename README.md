* **Data Analysis & Interpretation:**
  * **Spotify Dataset Analysis:** Analyzed trends to inform potential organizational projects[cite: 15]. Investigated the relationship between track 'danceability' and 'popularity', concluding that popularity is influenced by multiple factors beyond just danceability[cite: 16, 17, 18].
  * **Health Dataset Analysis:** Analyzed health data to identify trends for potential organizational support[cite: 19]. Found higher cancer aggregates in men compared to women (2005-2008) across various cancer types (liver, stomach, lung), despite a slightly smaller male population[cite: 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. Identified potential areas for NHS investigation regarding lifestyle, work, or genetic factors influencing higher cancer rates in men[cite: 25, 26].
